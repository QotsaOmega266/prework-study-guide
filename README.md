## Description

a website function.

## Usage

This Prework study guide is made to help studetns of the bootcamp understand more of each section that is covered throughout the course.
Each section contains notes and samples of a certain topic. HTML covers the foundations to build a website, CSS offers how to give a 
website its visual design and appeal, Javascript explains how we can make our site more interactive, and Git creates new branches to 
work on for our project as well as keeping track of what branch we're in. To access what these topics are, enter Chrome Devtools by
pressing Control+Shift+I. A console appears next to the webpage with a list on what topics to study first.
